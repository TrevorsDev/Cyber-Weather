# Weather Waffles

## Description
This app searches for and displays live and future weather data onto the screen with a visual "cyber-punk" theme.

### Motivations
The motivation behind this project was to further my knowledge, and ability to implement my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and how these tecnologies interact with one another to create a fun, functional, and asthetic looking web page that populates a weather forecast, while keeping log of each city searched. 

### Issues it Resolves
This simple website solves an issue people might have with other weather websites like populating too much data on the screen after a given search. Too much data can often overwhelm a user who simply wants to view the most important criteria without being distracted, or having to scan through an unnecessary amount of data. With this website I aimed to make it stand out asthetically, and provide the user with only a few items of weather information for the current, and five day forecast.

This project helped me understand more deeply what JavaScript and APIs mean. It also helped brighten my vision of what is possible using these technologies. Overall, it was a great way to take something usefull, and fun to create as a means to further my understanding of the front end of web development.
