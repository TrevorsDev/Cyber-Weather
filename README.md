# Cyber Weather

## Description
This app searches for and displays live and future weather data onto the screen with a visual "cyber-punk" theme.

### Motivations
The motivation behind this project was to further my knowledge, and ability to implement my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, and how these tecnologies interact with one another to create a fun, functional, and asthetic looking web page that populates a weather forecast, while keeping log of each city searched. 

### Issues it Resolves
This simple website solves an issue people might have with other weather websites like populating too much data on the screen after a given search. Too much data can often overwhelm a user who simply wants to view the most important criteria without being distracted, or having to scan through an unnecessary amount of data. With this website I aimed to make it stand out asthetically, and provide the user with only a few items of weather information for the current, and five day forecast.

This project helped me understand more deeply what JavaScript and APIs mean. It helped brighten my vision of what is possible using these technologies. I also grew in my ability to style a webpage and add a new level of responsiveness to it that I hadn't yet possesed before. Overall, it was a great way to take something usefull, and fun to create as a means to further my understanding of the front end of web development.

## Usage

### Cyber Weather Website:

To use this website, the user will simply type a city into the search box located below the "Search for a City" header, and either click the "Submit" button or press the "Enter" key on their keyboard. After the first city is searched, the current weather will display directly below the "Weather Dashboard" header. A 5-Day Forecast will display just below that, and the searched cities will show up as responsive buttons below the "Submit" button, which will allow the user to re-search their previous cities.

## Testing
While creating this program, I tested my code very little. I spent most of this project working closely with a detail oriented tutor, who thoroughly guided and helped me understand every line of code I created with her. Creating this program solely on my own was not feasable, as the concepts I have learned, I have only just barely been able to learn to read. Working together was the most fruitful way for me to understand what I needed to do and how I needed to think. Any testing was done by using the inspect tool and referring to the console.

## Credits
This project wouldn't have been possible without the amazing help of Bobbi Turkany and many of the "Ask BCS" tutors that helped me further my understanding of the entire front-end web developempent, and JavaScript process.
